# Interfacing-16x2-LCD-with-8051-Microcontroller

The provided code is a C program for interfacing a 16x2 LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) with an 8051 microcontroller.
The 8051 microcontroller is a popular 8-bit microcontroller widely used in embedded systems.

The LCD is controlled in 4-bit mode, meaning only four data lines are used to communicate with the display, namely D4, D5, D6, and D7.
The three control lines used are RS (Register Select), RW (Read/Write), and E (Enable).

In summary, this code demonstrates how to interface a 16x2 LCD with an 8051 microcontroller and display hexadecimal numbers on it.
The LCD is initialized with specific commands, and the value of num is continuously decremented and displayed on the screen. Once num reaches 0x00, the LCD is cleared, and the process starts again.
